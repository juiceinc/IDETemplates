# How to create file templates

## Tips

* Use TODOs to indicate what parts of the new file need to be customized.

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ uses the Velocity template engine. 

* ${PACKAGE_NAME} - the name of the target package where the new class or interface will be created.
* ${USER} - login name of the current user.
* ${DATE} - the current system date.
* ${TIME} - the current system time.
* ${YEAR} - the current year.
* ${MONTH} - the current month.
* ${DAY} - the current day of the month.
* ${HOUR} - the current hour.
* ${MINUTE} - the current minute.

You can also include other files with `#parse("template_name.extension")`. If you reference a variable name that doesn't exist, the user will be prompted in the dialog box to name the file.
